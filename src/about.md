  description: A brief outline of my biography and interests

I was born in Soviet Union times, in a Siberian town called Angarsk to a family of Soviet intelligentsia.
My father was a construction engineer working as a Deputy Chief Technology Officer in a design institution.
My mother was an architect, at the top of her career she was working as a Chief of the Urban Planning Department in the Administration of Angarsk City.

I happened to get my school education in a school with a mathematical focus. This school was very well known in Soviet times.
I was not really good at mathematics naturally, but the school definitely influenced my decision to enter the Department of Mechanics anb Mathematics in the Novosibirsk State University which I finished in 1993 with an equivalent of a Masters Degree (this was the first cohort of Masters in the history of this University).

To be honest, I was heading to the Novosibirsk University with a strong determination to become a programmer, but something went wrong and I applied for enrollment to a pure mathematical major.

(TBC)
